# About-Me
this is a page that we had as an assignment that will be later changed a little bit to serve as a sort of extention to my CV and also as a little portfolio
Things used so far
- Visual studio code
- for now its basically just html css and js but as over time i plan to add some more variety

Also it is important to note that it may seem a little disorganized as i use classes for stuff and sometimes i use selectors such as div under the class in css its mostly intentionall to show that im flexible and can work with many different styles 

I still have a project that i want to add which is basically a webpage for a store i worked on while i was a dev professionally but im currently having issues that will take some time to resolve so it's on hold

Plan to expand it with bootsrap/react gonna probably develop it over time as i will begin working as a teacher soon

WIP = work in progress
